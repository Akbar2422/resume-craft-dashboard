# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Storage Setup

### 1. Create "resumes" Storage Bucket
1. Go to the Storage section in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click "Create Bucket" and name it "resumes"
3. Set Access Control to "Authenticated users only"

### 2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
After creating the bucket, add these policies:

#### For SELECT operations (downloading resumes):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own resumes" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
USING (bucket_id = 'resumes' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

#### For INSERT operations (uploading resumes):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own resumes" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'resumes' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
    AND (storage.extension(name) = 'pdf')
    AND (octet_length(contents) < 5242880) -- 5MB limit
);
```

#### For UPDATE operations (replacing resumes):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own resumes" 
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
    bucket_id = 'resumes' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
)
WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'resumes' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
    AND (storage.extension(name) = 'pdf')
    AND (octet_length(contents) < 5242880)
);
```

#### For DELETE operations:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own resumes" 
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE 
USING (
    bucket_id = 'resumes' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

## Authentication Setup

1. Go to Authentication â†’ Settings in your Supabase dashboard
2. Ensure "Email" provider is enabled
3. Configure site URL and redirect URLs if needed
4. Customize email templates (optional)

## Testing the Setup

After implementing these settings, your application should:

1. Allow users to sign up and log in with email/password
2. Create user-specific folders in the "resumes" bucket automatically 
3. Allow users to upload/view/delete only their own resumes
